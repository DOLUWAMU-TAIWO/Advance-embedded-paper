abstract = {Softcore processors are an attractive alternative to using radiation-hardened processors in space-based applications. Unlike traditional processors however, the logic and routing of a softcore processor are vulnerable to the effects of single-event upsets (SEUs). This paper applies two common SEU mitigation techniques, TMR with checkpointing and DWC with checkpointing, to the LEON3 softcore processor. The improvement in reliabilty over an unmitigated version of the processor is measured using three metrics: the architectural vulnerability factor (AVF), mean time to failure (MTTF), and mean useful instructions to failure (MuITF). Using configuration memory fault injection, we found that DWC with checkpointing improves the MTTF and MuITF by over 35x, and that TMR with triplicated input and outputs improves the MTTF and MITF by over 6000x.},

  note = {In this presentation, Erik Engheim delves into the design of RISC-V and how it differs significantly from other industry standards like x86 and ARM. He discusses RISC-V's advantages in embedded systems design and specialized hardware tasks, including high-performance computing and machine learning. RISC-V is described not just as an open instruction-set architecture but also as a radical departure from established industry conventions.}
